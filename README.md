# vasp
Toolkit for analyzing the output files and generating the input files for VASP density functional theory simulations.


## Getting Started

The following programs are used to generate and evaluate some of the basic files used in our VASP modeling:

- POSCAR_generator.py
- NEB_image_generator.py
- ENCUT_generate.py
- ENCUT_scrape.py

A basic understanding of the POSCAR, INCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS, and OUTCAR files is necessary. Please read through the VASP wiki on these topics and the file formats if you have not already done so. https://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/wiki/index.php/The_VASP_Manual


## Installing
These programs utilize the following libraries:
- tikinter
- os
- shutil
- numpy
- re
- matplotlib


### POSCAR_generator
This program generates a POSCAR file with calculated atomic positions when provided the crystal structure type, repeating cell size, and lattice parameter. Currently, POSCAR_generator is developed to handle simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal types. 

#### Input
If the user defines the following variables in the first several lines of the code:

element = "W"
atomic_structure = "bcc"
lattice_parameter = 3.22
box_size = 2

#### Output
A POSCAR file is created in the same directory as the the current directory as the POSCAR_generator.py file. The output of the this example reads:

W bcc\
6.44\
1 0 0\
0 1 0\
0 0 1\
16\
Direct\
0.0 0.0 0.0\
0.0 0.0 0.5\
0.0 0.5 0.0\
0.0 0.5 0.5\
0.25 0.25 0.25\
0.25 0.25 0.75\
0.25 0.75 0.25\
0.25 0.75 0.75\
0.5 0.0 0.0\
0.5 0.0 0.5\
0.5 0.5 0.0\
0.5 0.5 0.5\
0.75 0.25 0.25\
0.75 0.25 0.75\
0.75 0.75 0.25\
0.75 0.75 0.75

The correct structure can then be validated by opening the newly generated POSCAR file in VESTA.

The above picture confirms an 2x2x2 FCC structure. 

### NEB_image_generator
This program generates the required POSCAR files and folders to run a nudged elastic band (NEB) calculation on VASP. A linear interpolation is performed between the starting and ending points and of the CONTCAR_ei (initial) and CONTCAR_ef (final) files. The CONTCAR_ei and CONTCAR_ef files are generated by performing individual relaxations of the starting and ending configurations. 


#### Input
The user must specify the number of images to create and the total number of atoms in the simulation, including the migrating species. For instance, if a 2x2x2 FCC cell has 16 atoms in the host matrix and a single migrating oxygen atom, 5 images could be generated by modifying the first several lines of code to:

num_images = 5
num_atoms = 17
